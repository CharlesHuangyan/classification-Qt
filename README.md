We do all for the learning of Qt !!!

Hello world!
I`m Charles Huang.It is so amazing to join the GitHub world.
When I learned Qt by myself,I found it sometimes difficult to collect specific 
resource.However,GitHub is obvious an access to solve this problem.
Recently,something unhappy happened between my girlfriend and me.I think we 
should keep away from each other for a week and calm down.
That`s it.
